          <h1>1. Introduction</h1>
          <p>
            We care deeply about your privacy and the data you share with us.
            Protecting your personal information is one of our highest
            priorities, and we take all reasonable measures to keep it safe.
            This Privacy Policy explains what data we collect, how we use it,
            and the steps we take to ensure your information remains secure
            while using our services.
          </p>

          <h1>2. Information we collect</h1>
          <p>
            When creating an account on GrooveShare, our backend system collects
            only a public key created from your passkey creation, along with
            info you provide during onboarding (username, profile picture). Any
            data you create after signing up (e.x. posts, likes etc.) also get
            stored securely on our backend system. We do not collect or store
            passwords, email addresses, or 2FA codes. Passkeys may be synced
            through Apple iCloud Keychain or Google Password Manager, which are
            managed by the respective platforms and are outside our control.
          </p>

          <h1>3. How Information is Used</h1>
          <p>
            None of your personal data is sold to third parties, and none of
            your content or account information is used to train AI models. We
            use your data solely to provide and improve the app, maintain the
            service, troubleshoot issues, and ensure a safe and enjoyable
            experience for all users. You remain in control of your data, and we
            are committed to being fully transparent about how it is stored and
            handled.

          <h1>4. Your Rights</h1>
          <p>
            You can request deletion of your user-generated content at any time.
            You can manage which devices are associated with your account
            passkeys.

          <h1>5. Security Measures</h1>
          <p>
            We implement industry-standard security measures for stored data,
            but passkeys themselves are managed by Apple/Google.

          <h1>6. Governing Law & Updates to our Privacy Policy</h1>
          <p>
            This Policy is governed by [jurisdiction] law. We may update this
            Policy if deemed necessary or if the law requires it and continued
            use of the app constitutes acceptance of any changes.
